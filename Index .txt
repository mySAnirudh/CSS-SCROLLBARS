
  *** Scrollbars ***

  There may be a case when an element's content might be larger than the 
amount of space allocated to it. For example, the given width and height 
properties do not allow enough room to accommodate the content of the 
element.
CSS provides a property called overflow, which tells the browser what to do if the 
box's contents is larger than the box itself. This property can take one of the 
following values:
Value Description
visible Allows the content to overflow the borders of its containing element.
hidden The content of the nested element is simply cut off at the border of 
the containing element and no scrollbars is visible.
scroll The size of the containing element does not change, but the scrollbars 
are added to allow the user to scroll to see the content.
auto The purpose is the same as scroll, but the scrollbar will be shown only 
if the content does overflow.
